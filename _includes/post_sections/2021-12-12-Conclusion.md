## What have we learnt and what can we do?

We started by the premise that women probably are underrepresented in US media and set out to verify this with the help of Quotebank. Of course we hoped in secret that this would not come true and the situation would not be as bad as we thought, but unfortunately the numbers are quite telling. Neither in front nor behind the scenes, women’s voices are promoted equal to men’s with almost 65 % of editors among the highest traffic media outlets being controlled by men. However, the picture looks quite different with respect to the political bias of the media - while in right-leaning media “only” 64 % are lead by men, on the left spectrum the number rises even to 74% or almost three forth…
Still, when it comes to giving women a stage in the media, it looks even more grim with less than a forth of quotes being issued by women… And once one zooms in to what women are asked about, it does not necessarily get better. 
We clearly see a case of women being overly represented in accounts about personal stories, health and lifestyle while men are left to discuss politics, business, global issues and sports either altogether or at higher proportions.
Just as it is not a sign of sincere inclusion when minorities are only asked to comment on minority issues but are kept quiet for all other topics that concern society, women being kept in their niches, although being “dominant” there, has nothing to do with equal female representation.
This niche issue becomes even more apparent when studying the portion of quotes specifically mentioning men and women. While sports appears as a topic largely dominated either by male speakers or male protagonists this can hardly be seen as a defining  “male topic”. It is rather another imbalance that the only sport of public interest is performed by men…
In contrast, “the” female issue in the USA is the ideological battle around reproductive rights , which “nicely” emerges also in the work we have done as a proper topic (out of seven!!!). While it is important to thematize topics that move society, this becomes problematic if half of the population has to find a place in the limited number of narratives dominating the media landscape. This over-emphasis further engrains the misrepresentation of women and reducing them to their bodily functions (and skills as a mother).
Our vision therefore is that when we reconduct this study in 20 years, the topics treated by women have become interchangeable with those of men, by men and all the other minorities for whom we have not even started to investigate represenation…
For that to happen, all that remains to say is:
