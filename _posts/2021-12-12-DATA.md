## Primary dataset - [Quotebank](https://quotebank.dlab.tools/)

While the original dataset stems from Quotebank and spans comprehensively the English-speaking media world from 2012 to early 2020, for the subsequent analysis we trimmed it down to quotes originating from US media. Furthermore, not all quotes had identified speakers, making it impossible to determine their gender further reducing our starting dataset.

## Secondary dataset

But then, we had a quite boring dataset not suited to go on an ADAventure into the US media landscape. Beyond the wikilinks to the identified speakers, which were already part of Quotebank, there was not much to explore. Thus we expanded the horizons of our dataset by first of all linking it to the glorious online resource [Media Bias / Fact Check](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/), that provided us exactly with what we needed: They are a comprehensive database of a majority of English speaking (and an even larger portion of American media) and both classify them on their factual reporting, their political bias (left-leaning, right-leaning) and th




### Clean dataset:

- restrict ourselves to quotes containing infromatino about gender above a CERTAIN probability threshold so can be assigned to women/men/other

- can show our initial analysis here about proportion

- further cleaning

## Enhanced dataset by other sources 

- Extraction of gender from wikidata
- 
- Extraction of provenance of media outlets and their political biasby scraping information from https://mediabiasfactcheck.com, an online resource created to help navigate the bias in the flood of new online media emerging every day by classifying their country of origin, their rank in factual reporting and their political bias

### Subset:

- We focus on studying female representation in the cultural realm of the USA thus only selecting media from the US or focusing on the US

- While for the descriptive analyses we look at all media outlets from the USA, for the topic analyses we restrict ourselves further by investigating the **top 10** most frequented media
  - Webscraping to get frequency estimates
    - within frequencies use number of quotes as additional estimate to rank - aware that not perfect
